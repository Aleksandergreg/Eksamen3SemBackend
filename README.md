Deciding on a Framework

Initial I have looked at the StackOverFlow survey  and the GitHub blog post about the most popular programming languages, and from this trying to make a data-driven decision, narrowing it down to the following languages and micro web-frameworks:


Rust - Rocket
Ruby - Sinatra
Go - Gorilla

From here I have then looked more extensively into the languages above, and have made this list of pros and cons from where I currently stand in my professional career, taking into consideration about my current knowledge, interests and workload from the outside, e.g having a life outside of school and other electives that we are currently undergoing.


Language
Pros
Cons
Rust - rocket
Widely used
Strong documentation
Modern language features
Steep learning curve
Strict ownership model
Borrow checker
Doesn’t seem to follow the logic or syntax of anything already known
Go - Gorilla
Designed for simplicity and performance
Built in HTTP package - easy to use
Easy to pick up if already familiar with Java
Not as used as Rust, but still widely used
A lot of boilerplate code
Gorilla is Archived by 2023


Ruby - Sinatra
Super simple and minimalistic
Syntax should be almost like normal english, very intuitive
Large ecosystem and documentation
Good if you’re familiar with the JavaScript syntax, as it enforces a lot of the same logic
Strong emphasis on Developer happines
Very beginner friendly
Not as scalable as Go or Rust (even though in this project it shouldn’t be the biggest hurdle)
Lower performance than Go and Rust




Based on this I definitely don’t feel like doing the project in Rust, and I’m most fond of choosing Ruby with Sinatra, as it feels strange to take on a framework that has been archived for two years. Go on the other hand seems very interesting to take on, as I really enjoy the logic and syntax of Java. Will write more here, when we have discussed it in the group, and have heard their opinions, but at this point I am open to both Ruby and Go.
