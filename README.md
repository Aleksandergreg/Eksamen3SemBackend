# Deciding on a Framework

Initial I have looked at the StackOverFlow survey  and the GitHub blog post about the most popular programming languages, and from this trying to make a data-driven decision, narrowing it down to the following languages and micro web-frameworks:

Rust - Rocket  
Ruby - Sinatra  
Go - Gorilla  

From here I have then looked more extensively into the languages above, and have made this list of pros and cons from where I currently stand in my professional career, taking into consideration about my current knowledge, interests and workload from the outside, e.g having a life outside of school and other electives that we are currently undergoing.

## Language

| Language        | Pros                                                                                                                                                                             | Cons                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rust - rocket   | Widely used <br> Strong documentation <br> Modern language features                                                                                                              | Steep learning curve <br> Strict ownership model <br> Borrow checker <br> Doesn’t seem to follow the logic or syntax of anything already known                                  |
| Go - Gorilla    | Designed for simplicity and performance <br> Built in HTTP package - easy to use <br> Easy to pick up if already familiar with Java <br> Not as used as Rust, but still widely used | A lot of boilerplate code <br> Gorilla is Archived by 2023                                                                                                                      |
| Ruby - Sinatra  | Super simple and minimalistic <br> Syntax should be almost like normal english, very intuitive <br> Large ecosystem and documentation <br> Good if you’re familiar with the JavaScript syntax, as it enforces a lot of the same logic <br> Strong emphasis on Developer happines <br> Very beginner friendly | Not as scalable as Go or Rust (even though in this project it shouldn’t be the biggest hurdle) <br> Lower performance than Go and Rust                                            |

Based on this I definitely don’t feel like doing the project in Rust, and I’m most fond of choosing Ruby with Sinatra, as it feels strange to take on a framework that has been archived for two years. Go on the other hand seems very interesting to take on, as I really enjoy the logic and syntax of Java. Will write more here, when we have discussed it in the group, and have heard their opinions, but at this point I am open to both Ruby and Go.
